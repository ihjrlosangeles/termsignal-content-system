## 1. Define the Service Level Objective (SLO)
- Example: 99.9% availability over a 30-day rolling window

## 2. Calculate the Error Budget
- Error Budget = 100% - SLO
- Example: 0.1% (100% - 99.9%) over 30 days

## 3. Quantify the Error Budget
- Convert percentage to actual numbers
- Example: 0.1% of 30 days = 43.2 minutes

## 4. Determine Error Budget Burn Rate Thresholds
- Set multiple thresholds for different alert severities
- Example:
  - Warning: 2x normal burn rate
  - Critical: 10x normal burn rate

## 5. Define the SLI (Service Level Indicator)
- Example: Percentage of successful requests vs. total requests

## 6. Implement Measurement and Tracking
- Set up monitoring to continuously track the SLI
- Aggregate data over the specified time window (30 days)

## 7. Create the Alarm Logic
```
IF (ErrorBudgetConsumed > (ErrorBudgetTotal * 0.75)) THEN
    Trigger Warning Alert
ELSE IF (ErrorBudgetConsumed > (ErrorBudgetTotal * 0.90)) THEN
    Trigger Critical Alert
```

## 8. Set Up Alerting Channels
- Define where and how alerts will be sent (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty)

## 9. Document Response Procedures
- Create runbooks for responding to different alert levels

## 10. Implement and Test
- Deploy the alarm in a test environment
- Validate its accuracy and responsiveness

## 11. Monitor and Refine
- Regularly review alarm effectiveness
- Adjust thresholds and logic as needed
